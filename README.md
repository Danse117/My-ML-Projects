## P1: Decision Tree Classifier

Created a decision tree classifier to classify if a sample were to survive or perish during the sinking of the Titanic, using the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv).

---
## P2: Classifying with Perceptron and Linear Regression

Created and trained a perceptron and linear regression algorithm to classify if a sample can be considered "hazardous" using a [NASA Nearest Earth Objects Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivansher/nasa-nearest-earth-objects-1910-2024).

Compared the training and results of perceptron and linear regression models

## P3: Creating a basic CNN/Understanding and configuring hyper-parameters

Created a CNN for the AND Gate and used Pytorch to generate a model for replicating right-hand posing. Tested to see the effectiveness of certain hyperparameters during multiple runs of training.
